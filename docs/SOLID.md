# SOLID Principles

The invention of SOLID principles began in the late 80s. Robert C. Martin started to develop these principles while discussing software design on USENET (an early kind of Facebook). After refinement, Robert C. Martin formulated the principles in the early 2000s. In 2004, the principles were arranged and called SOLID principles. SOLID is an acronym that stands for five specific design principles:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle
- **O**: Open Closed Principle
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle

The SOLID principles are useful when constructing both individual modules and larger architectures. Below, we explore each principle alongside examples in JavaScript.
